# VueJS Todo Application - CSoC Dev Web Task 3

## Introduction

In this task you will be working on a todo application made using NuxtJS a SSR framework for VueJS. The main motive of this task is to make you familiar with:

- Life Cycle Hooks in VueJS
- Data Fetching and Rendering
- Component Creation
- Custom Events
- Class Binding
- State Manegment

## Setting up the project

Follow the following steps to setup this project.

**Note** - This task requires [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) which is a new tooling similar to npm that you encountered in last task.

### Fork this repository
First of all, click on the top-right corner of this repository to fork it.

### Create a local clone of your fork
Then, clone your forked repository using this command:
```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/csoc-week3-vue.git
```

Change your current directory to the repo's root.
```
cd csoc-week3-vue
```

### Run the server

Install the dependencies using
```
pnpm i
```

Then you can finally run the server using this command.
```
pnpm run dev
```

Then you can go to `localhost:3000` in your browser.

### Deploying App

You can use netlify or vercel for deploying your app. The build command is
```
pnpm run build
pnpm run generate
```

This will create a `dist` folder which can be served now

## Todo Application

There are three pages in this site.

- `/` - This is the main page where the user can create, edit or delete the tasks.
- `/login` - This is the login page.
- `/register` - This is the register page.

We have also created a backend server containing the API endpoints required for this application to function completely  - [https://todo-app-csoc.herokuapp.com/](https://todo-app-csoc.herokuapp.com/)

You are already familiar with API from last task if not find more details at [Task-2-Web](https://github.com/COPS-CSOC-2022/csoc-task-2-web#api-usage)

## Tasks
You would notice that the application is not functional completely. So, your task is to make it completely functional. You would be working in :
- [Landing](./pages/index.vue)
- [Register](./pages/register/index.vue)
- [Login](./pages/login/index.vue)
- [Add Task](./components/addTask.vue)
- [Auth Middleware](./middleware/auth.ts)

There are several todos mentioned in these files. You have to complete those.

In particular you have to

- **Auth middleware** - You may notice that initially you are landed on the main page even when you are not logged in. That is wrong. In [auth.ts](./middleware/auth.ts) you have to add the logic for redirection based on he/she/them is authenticated or not. You will also be require to integrate your middleware into pages/router.

- **Login Function** - Currently only register function works. You have to complete the login function too present in [Login](./pages/login/index.vue). And then change the state in store.

- **Get Tasks function** - There is a function `getTasks` in [Index](./pages/index.vue). You would notice that even after logging in, you see two tasks *Sample Task 1* and *Sample Task 2*. These tasks were not created by you. These are dummy tasks. You have complete the `getTasks` function such that the tasks listed are the ones created by the user.

- **Add Task** - This functionality is spread over two functions [addTask](./component/addTask.vue) and [fetchTask](./pages/index.vue) which you have to complete by making API call and finally adding element to DOM.

- **Delete Task function** - This functions is present in the [Index](./pages/index.vue) file. You have to complete it.

- **Update Task** - This functions is present in the [Index](./pages/index.vue) file. To complete this you have to add in functionality for class binding/ conditional rendering to toggle elements. Finally complete the `updateTask` function.

- **UI Improvement** - Add in trasition for list by using vue transition component and combining css transitions.

## Points
Here is the breakdown of the points related to each task.

|**Task**|**Points**  |
|--|--|
| Auth Middleware | 15 |
| Login Function | 15 |
| Add task | 25 |
| Get tasks | 25 |
| Update Task | 35 |
| Delete Task | 35 |
| Bonus | 30 |
|**Total**|180|

## Judging
Judging would be done on the basis of your implementation and authenticity.
